# Travel Recommendation System | Content-Based Filtering

# Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the recommendation system for travel destinations by leveraging logistic regression modeling and cosine similarity calculations. By analyzing historical data and destination attributes, the system predicts user interest in various travel destinations and provides personalized recommendations tailored to individual preferences.

# Key Features
1. Logistic Regression Modeling
2. Feature Adjustment
3. Cosine Similarity Integration

# 1. Logistic Regression Model Training
* Objective: Predict user interests based on historical destination data.
* Process: Train a logistic regression model using historical destination data and user interactions. Learn the relationship between destination attributes and user interests.

# 2. Adjusting Destination Feature Vectors
* Objective: Prioritize destinations based on logistic regression predictions.
* Process: Utilize the trained logistic regression model to adjust the feature vectors of destinations. Prioritize destinations that are more likely to match a user's interests.

# 3. Cosine Similarity Calculation
Objective: Identify destinations similar to the user's preferences.
Process: Calculate cosine similarity between adjusted destination feature vectors and user preference feature vectors. Measure the similarity between destinations and user preferences.

# 4. Generating Recommendations
Objective: Provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
Process: Sort destinations in descending order of cosine similarity scores. Display top recommended destinations for each user based on similarity scores.

# Benefits
* Enhanced Recommendation Accuracy: By incorporating logistic regression predictions and cosine similarity calculations, the recommendation system offers more accurate and personalized recommendations aligned with user preferences.
* Improved User Experience: Users can discover relevant travel destinations more efficiently, leading to increased satisfaction and engagement with the platform.

## Summary: 
By combining logistic regression predictions with cosine similarity calculations, the recommendation system delivers accurate and personalized travel destination recommendations tailored to individual user preferences.

# Usage
To utilize the recommendation system:

* Train the logistic regression model using historical destination data to predict user interests.
* Enhance destination feature vectors based on logistic regression predictions to prioritize destinations aligned with user interests.
* Calculate cosine similarity between adjusted destination vectors and user preference vectors to identify similar destinations.
* Present personalized travel destination recommendations to users based on cosine similarity scores.

## Feel free to adapt and expand upon this recommendation system to suit your specific application requirements and user preferences!
